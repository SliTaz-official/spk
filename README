SliTaz Spk
================================================================================


The SliTaz Spk toolset provides tools and utils to handle SliTaz packages.


Spk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spk is the main tool to handle and play with SliTaz packages, it handles multiple
packages on a cmdline and a wide range of --options which will perform tasks such
as adding or removing packages using the toolset. Spk itself provides some small
commands such as ls or info.


Toolset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spk is separated into many small tools following the UNIX philosophy: one tool
for one task but do that task well. Here is a list of proposed tools and their
functions:

	* spk-ls     : List packages and packages files
	* spk-add    : Install local or online pkgs
	* spk-rm     : Remove packages with confirm in option
	* spk-up     : Upgrade the whole system
	* spk-search : Search for packages or files
	* spk-archive: Manage package extraction, compression, and packing
	* spk-mirror : Manage mirrors and undigest


LibSpk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libspk provides base functions and internal variables used by almost all spk-tools.
Libspk must be installed vis 'make install-lib' to develop spk-tools.

	* Source: libtaz.sh, libpkg.sh, slitaz.conf
	* Internal Spk variables (lowercase, not configurable)
	* Display package info
	* ...


Devnotes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some random and useful notes.

	* packages.desc format: package | 1.0 | desc | category | website
	* packages.md5 format : de9f76250657000958ee0120d376613e  package-1.0.tazpkg
	* ...

Since we use latest libtaz.sh, slitaz.conf and libpkg.sh code you must install
these files to develop the Spk Toolset:

	$ hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-base-files
	$ cd slitaz-base-files
	$ make install-libtaz
	$ make install-libpkg
	$ make install-slitaz


Coding style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the spk coding style notes, follow them if you want your code included
in the package. These rules are in addition to cookutils coding style, please
also read cookutils/README


	* No bash, be Busybox Ash compatible
	* Use libtaz.sh, slitaz.conf and libpkg.sh
	* ...
